\f0\fs26 \cf0 An event notification library\
\
The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached. Furthermore, libevent also support callbacks due to signals or regular timeouts.\
\
Libevent is meant to replace the event loop found in event driven network servers. An application just needs to call event_dispatch() and then add or remove events dynamically without having to change the event loop.}]]></resource></locale></resources><flags/><item type="file">01libevent.xml</item><mod>properties.title</mod><mod>description</mod></pkmkdoc>
