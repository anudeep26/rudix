File compressor with a high compression ratio

Rzip is a compression program that is similar to gzip and bzip2. The primary difference is that rzip is able to exploit long distance redundancies in files, which enables rzip to produce much better compression ratios (sometimes). However, the drawbacks of rzip are that one cannot pipeline rzip and it is very memory-intensive.
