ABOUT RUDIX

Rudix features a world class collection of pre-compiled and ready
to use Unix compatible software which are not available from a fresh
installation of Mac OS X but are popular among other Unix environments.
Here you can find utilities, programming languages, libraries and
tools delivered as standard Mac OS X packages.

Rudix provides for system administrators and developers a powerful
and easy to customize port system where you can retrieve, compile
and build native Mac OS X software for public distribution (both
.pkg and .dmg).  Rudix is proud to keep this tradition of using
Unix port systems.
